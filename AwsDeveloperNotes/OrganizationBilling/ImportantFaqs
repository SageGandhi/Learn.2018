Aws Provided Account & Amazon Internet Services Private Limited Provided Account[Based On Indian Address].Payer Account & Linked Account.When you used consolidated billing in 
the Billing and Cost Management console, you had one account that was designated as a payer account.The payer account paid the charges that were accrued by all the other 
accounts, known as linked accounts, in your consolidated billing family.The same idea applies to AWS Organizations: Each organization has one account, called a master account,
that pays the charges of all the member accounts in that organization.The member accounts are linked to the master account for billing purposes, just like the linked accounts 
in consolidated billing were linked to a payer account.
