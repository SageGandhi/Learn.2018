Aws Provided Account & Amazon Internet Services Private Limited Provided Account[Based On Indian Address].Payer Account & Linked Account.When you used consolidated billing in 
the Billing and Cost Management console, you had one account that was designated as a payer account.The payer account paid the charges that were accrued by all the other 
accounts, known as linked accounts, in your consolidated billing family.The same idea applies to AWS Organizations: Each organization has one account, called a master account,
that pays the charges of all the member accounts in that organization.The member accounts are linked to the master account for billing purposes, just like the linked accounts 
in consolidated billing were linked to a payer account.

============================================================================04:Simple Notification Service=====================================================================
When Amazon SNS sends a Notification to a subscribed HTTP or HTTPS endpoint, the POST message sent to the endpoint has a message body that contains a JSON document with the 
following name/value pairs:Message/MessageId/Signature/SignatureVersion/SigningCertURL/Subject[Optional]/Timestamp/TopicArn/Type/UnsubscribeURL.
============================================================================05:Identity&Access Management======================================================================
Names Of IAM User Will Not Contain #.Names of users, groups, roles, policies, instance profiles, and server certificates must be alphanumeric, including the following common 
characters: plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at (@), underscore (_), and hyphen (-).https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html
============================================================================06:Identity&Access Management======================================================================
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc.html: 
Imagine that you are creating a mobile app that accesses AWS resources, such as a game that runs on a mobile device and stores player and score information using Amazon S3 and 
DynamoDB.When you write such an app, you'll make requests to AWS services that must be signed with an AWS access key. However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or 
distribute long-term AWS credentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security
credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the 
tasks required by the mobile app.With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can 
sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) —such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP, receive an authentication 
token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP 
helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.For most scenarios, we recommend 
that you use Amazon Cognito because it acts as an identity broker and does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section, Using Amazon Cognito 
for Mobile Apps.If you don't use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible IdP) 
and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used 
this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#Overview.Tagging: Tags Are Used For Billing Purpose.Each Amazon RDS resource has a tag set, which 
contains all the tags that are assigned to that Amazon RDS resource. A tag set can contain as many as 10 tags, or it can be empty. If you add a tag to an Amazon RDS resource 
that has the same key as an existing tag on resource, the new value overwrites the old value.
============================================================================08:Elastic Compute Cloud===========================================================================
For Specific Amazon Machine Image Root Device Type Can Be Amazon EBS-backed AMI[ebs]/instance store-backed AMI[instance store].
EC2-Classic: We release the public and private IPv4 addresses for the instance when you stop the instance, and assign new ones when you restart it.EC2-VPC: The instance 
retains its private IPv4 addresses and any IPv6 addresses when stopped and restarted. We release the public IPv4 address and assign a new one when you restart it.

EC2-Classic: We disassociate any Elastic IP address that's associated with the instance. You're charged for Elastic IP addresses that aren't associated with an instance. 
When you restart the instance, you must associate the Elastic IP address with the instance; we don't do this automatically.EC2-VPC: The instance retains its associated 
Elastic IP addresses. You're charged for any Elastic IP addresses associated with a stopped instance.
============================================================================09:DynamoDB=======================================================================================
DynamoDB Supports Web Identity Federation Using Facebook,Google,Amazon As Identity Provider To request temporary security credentials.
============================================================================10:Elastic Compute Cloud==========================================================================
Billing commences when Amazon EC2 initiates the boot sequence of an AMI instance. Billing ends when the instance terminates, which could occur through a web services command, 
by running "shutdown -h", or through instance failure. When you stop an instance, we shut it down but don't charge hourly usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees, 
but we do charge for the storage for any Amazon EBS volumes.
============================================================================11:DynamoDB=======================================================================================
Every global secondary index must have a partition key, and can have an optional sort key. The index key schema can be different from the base table schema; you could have a 
table with a simple primary key (partition key), and create a global secondary index with a composite primary key (partition key and sort key) — or vice-versa. The index key 
attributes can consist of any top-level String, Number, or Binary attributes from the base table; other scalar types, document types, and set types are not allowed.

============================================================================13:Simple Notification Service=====================================================================
In order for customers to have broad flexibility of delivery mechanisms, Amazon SNS supports notifications over multiple transport protocols. Customers can select one the following transports as part of the subscription requests:
“HTTP”, “HTTPS” – Subscribers specify a URL as part of the subscription registration; notifications will be delivered through an HTTP POST to the specified URL.
”Email”, “Email-JSON” – Messages are sent to registered addresses as email. Email-JSON sends notifications as a JSON object, while Email sends text-based email.
“SQS” – Users can specify an SQS standard queue as the endpoint; Amazon SNS will enqueue a notification message to the specified queue (which subscribers can then process 
using SQS APIs such as ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, etc.). Note that FIFO queues are not currently supported.
“SMS” – Messages are sent to registered phone numbers as SMS text messages.
